# Exercise 3: Using Azure OpenAI on custom dataset
### Scenario summary:
This scenario allows use cases to use Open AI as an intelligent agent to answer questions from end users or assist them using knowledge of a proprietary corpus and domain.
Applications can be: 
- Giving a direct answer to questions about specific products, services and processes based on a knowledge corpus that can be updated frequently. This is an alternative to classic search where the result just documents with relevant information to the question. Think of this as Bing Chat on proprietary data.
- Giving recommendations & assistance: based on information that can be implicitly gathered about the user, formulate useful content for the user's purpose. For example, a travel website may utilize users' personal information, past posts, and transaction history to personalize recommendations when users need to be helped with creating next trip idea/itinerary.

Regardless of the application scenario, the solution flow is:
- Step 1 Prepare the context information: context information can be retrieved from proprietary knowledge corpus and other systems based on the user's query and user's information. The retrieval mechanism can be a semantic search engine to retrieve right content for an unstructured data corpus or SQL query in case of the structured dataset.
- Step 2 Formulate prompt to Open AI: from the context and depending on the goal of user, formulate GPT prompt to get the final response to the end user. For example, if it's knowledge retrieval vs recommendation

This implementation scenario focuses on building a knowledge retrieval chatbot application on top of an unstructured data corpus, but the same design can be used for the recommendation & generative scenarios.

From the user's query, the solution uses two-stage information retrieval to retrieve the content that best matches the user query. 
In stage 1, full-text search in Azure Cognitive Search is used to retrieve several relevant documents. In stage 2, the search result is applied with a pre-trained NLP model and embedding search to further narrow down the most relevant content. The content is used by the orchestrator service to form a prompt for the OpenAI deployment of LLM. The OpenAI service returns the result which is then sent to the Power App client application.

# Task 1: PowerApp


1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the **func-search-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** function app from the **openaicustom-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group.

12. Next, select the **Flows (1)** Pane, and click on **Edit (2)** for **Semantic-Search-Flow**. PowerAutomate Flow needs to be enabled. At this point, the powerapp can be run as is. It connects to a pre-built Azure Function App. 

    ![](./images/flows-1.1.png)

13. Edit the Power Automate Flow and update **Azure Function Url (1)** with the URL you copied earlier and append `&num_search_result=5` at the end. Your URL should look like the following. Click **Save (2)**.

    ```
